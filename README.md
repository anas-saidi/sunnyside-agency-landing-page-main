## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to practice laying out elements on the page using Flexbox & Grid Css . I also wrote my first two lines in javascript to make the humburger menu . The page had multiple sections which was a good opportunity to refresh on semantic html tags . I also learnt a lot about responsive design and media queries .

### Continued development

I'd like to practice using Grid a little bit more just to get the hang of it , especially properties that have to deal with the responsivness of the layout to avoid using media queries , i'm planning on starting a course on javascript next , so probably i'll be implementing a lot of what i'm learning on my next project to make it even more interactive .
